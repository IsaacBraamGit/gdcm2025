# GenDesignMC Challenge

This project is a solution for the [GenDesignMC Challenge](https://gendesignmc.wikidot.com/start), where the goal is to generate creative and coherent structures in Minecraft using procedural generation and AI-assisted techniques.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Python 3.10** (Make sure it's installed and active)
- Other dependencies will be handled automatically (see `_RunMe.py`)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Download this repository.**
2. **Set your Minecraft build area:**

   Run the following command in Minecraft:
    /setbuildarea ~0 ~0 ~0 ~300 ~100 ~300
3. **Run the script:**

From your terminal:
python _RunMe.py

Low-spec hardware?

If you're running on a lower-end machine, edit the _RunMe.py file and set:
LITE_VERSION = True

The code is currently functional but not optimized â€” a full refactor is planned.
